Online classes are going absolutely well. They are even taking care of the fitness of the children by arranging PET classes during morning sessions. This is first year of son at Tatva.

                        <br>The teachers here are very creative and friendly with the kids. Along with the academics and physical fitness, the life skills are also taught, which are very very important in the child's life. We can see our children growing, as independent & confident.

                        <br>Thanks to the complete group of Tatva family, who has brought this kind of wonderful& holistic development for the children.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Review By Kiran Tsp</kbd></h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="text-muted text-left">Both my kids are studying at Tatva since last 4 years & 2 years respectively. We have admitted my elder kid at Tatva when Tatva were into their third year and we don't know anything about the school (no CBSE affiliation, 300+ strength), only with a belief that Tatva would do well, since it was an upcoming school. I would say Tatva met the expectations so far and would continue to do so. They have acquired the CBSE affiliation in no time, added more strength (1500+ now??) & more infra.

                        <br>They give equal importance to studies & activities. The teaching staff is efficient and seen them following many best practices - like having the kids speak out a new spelling as a password to enter the class on a weekly basis - so that the kids remembers the spellings :-).
                        <br>Most importantly - the way they build a kid's confidence (& other soft skills) by encouraging them to tell a story or speak about something, during the assembly or during the class hours is commendable. I have seen/known many parents from other schools who used to send their kids to this place for swimming, that place for skating, another place for badminton etc. etc. (after school or during weekends) since their school doesn't have these facilities. But here - just send them to Tatva and all are taken care of :-).

                        <br>As the saying goes - the world is not perfect, you do notice some improvement areas. But the "always attentive" admin & solutions team swiftly takes care of them as soon as you bring them to their attention. On a closing note - My kids love going to Tatva :-).</p>
